# Image Search App

### Vanilla JavaScript App

#### Project description

##### Let's develop an image search app that empowers you to effortlessly find any desired image. Simply enter your search query, and the app will provide you with a curated selection of results accompanied by descriptions. The app is designed to be responsive, adapting gracefully to smaller screens by displaying images in a single column. Leveraging the capabilities of the Unsplash API, the app retrieves up to 1000 unique and non-repetitive images for your exploration. With its modern CSS design, the app delivers a swift and responsive user experience, making the process of searching for images, whether it's cats, dogs, or any other subject, an enjoyable endeavor.
